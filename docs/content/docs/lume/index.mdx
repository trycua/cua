Lume is a lightweight CLI and local API server for creating, running, and managing **macOS and Linux virtual machines** with near-native performance on Apple Silicon.

Built on Apple's [Virtualization.Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization), Lume was the first open-source product released by trycua - providing the foundation for the Computer Use Agent SDK.

## Key Features

- **Near-native performance** - Run macOS VMs at native speed using Apple's Virtualization Framework
- **Simple CLI** - Create, run, and manage VMs with intuitive commands
- **Prebuilt images** - Get started quickly with ready-to-use macOS and Linux images
- **HTTP API** - Integrate with your tools via the built-in REST API server
- **Unattended setup** - Automate macOS installation with YAML configuration files
