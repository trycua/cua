title: Vision Language Models
description: VLMs supported by the Cua Agent Framework
---

A **Vision Language Model (VLM)** is the AI that powers your computer-use agent. It sees screenshots, reasons about what's on screen, and decides what action to take next. Cua supports models from cloud providers, open-source projects, and local inference.

## Using a Model

Specify the model when creating your agent:

```python
from computer import Computer
from agent import ComputerAgent

computer = Computer(os_type="linux", provider_type="docker", image="trycua/cua-xfce:latest")
await computer.run()

agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    tools=[computer]
)

async for result in agent.run("Open Firefox and search for 'Cua'"):
    print(result)
```

The model string tells Cua which provider and model to use. Cua automatically selects the right agent loop implementation for each model.

## Cloud Providers

Cloud-hosted models offer the best accuracy and require no local GPU. You'll need an API key from the provider (or use Cua VLM Router for unified access).

### Anthropic Claude

Claude models are optimized for computer-use with native tool support.

```python
# Claude Sonnet 4.5 - best balance of speed and accuracy
agent = ComputerAgent(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", tools=[computer])

# Claude Haiku 4.5 - faster, lower cost
agent = ComputerAgent(model="anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20250929", tools=[computer])
```

Set your API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### OpenAI

OpenAI's computer-use preview model:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(model="openai/computer-use-preview", tools=[computer])
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### Google Gemini

Gemini 2.5 Computer-Use is optimized for **browser automation** rather than full desktop control. Use it with the [Browser Tool](/cua/guide/fundamentals/browser-tool) for web-based tasks:

```python
from agent.tools import BrowserTool

# Use with BrowserTool for web automation
agent = ComputerAgent(model="gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025", tools=[browser])
```

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
```

For full desktop computer-use, consider Anthropic Claude or OpenAI instead.

### Microsoft Fara

Fara is Microsoft's browser automation model, available via Azure ML. Like Gemini 2.5, it's designed for web tasks and works with the [Browser Tool](/cua/guide/fundamentals/browser-tool):

```python
from agent.tools import BrowserTool

agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="azure_ml/Fara-7B",
    tools=[browser],
    api_base="https://your-azure-endpoint.inference.ml.azure.com"
)
```

## Local Models

Run models on your own hardware for privacy, cost savings, or air-gapped environments. Local models require a GPU with sufficient VRAM (typically 16GB+ for 7B models).

### Using HuggingFace Models

```python
# UI-TARS - ByteDance's full computer-use model
agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="huggingface-local/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-1.5-7B",
    tools=[computer]
)

# Qwen 2.5 VL - Alibaba's full computer-use model
agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="huggingface-local/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
    tools=[computer]
)
```

The first run downloads model weights from HuggingFace. Subsequent runs load from cache.

### Using MLX (Apple Silicon)

For M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs, MLX provides optimized inference:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="mlx/mlx-community/UI-TARS-1.5-7B-6bit",
    tools=[computer]
)
```

MLX models run efficiently on Apple's unified memory architecture.

### Using Ollama

Run models locally via Ollama:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="ollama_chat/llama3.2:latest",
    tools=[computer]
)
```

Ollama handles model downloading and serves inference locally.

## Model Capabilities

Models fall into three categories based on what they can control:

### Full Computer-Use

These models can control any desktop application—clicking, typing, scrolling across the entire screen. They work with the standard `Computer` tool:

- **Anthropic Claude** (all versions)
- **OpenAI computer-use-preview**
- **UI-TARS** (ByteDance)
- **Qwen 2.5 VL** (Alibaba)

```python
# Full desktop control
agent = ComputerAgent(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", tools=[computer])
```

### Browser-Only

These models are optimized for web automation. They work with the `BrowserTool` and provide browser-specific actions like URL navigation and web search:

- **Gemini 2.5 Computer-Use** (Google)
- **Fara** (Microsoft)

```python
# Browser automation only
agent = ComputerAgent(model="gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025", tools=[browser])
```

See [Browser Tool](/cua/guide/fundamentals/browser-tool) for details.

### Grounding-Only

These models can locate UI elements but can't reason about what action to take. They must be composed with a planning model:

- **GTA1** (grounding)
- **OmniParser** (Microsoft, UI element detection)
- **Moondream3** (lightweight grounding)

```python
# Must be composed with a planning model
"omniparser+openai/gpt-4o"
"huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B+anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
```

## Choosing a Model

**For full desktop automation:** Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 or OpenAI computer-use-preview. They handle complex UIs and multi-application workflows.

**For web automation:** Use Gemini 2.5 or Fara with the Browser Tool. They have browser-specific optimizations like direct URL navigation.

**For local development:** UI-TARS 1.5 7B or Qwen 2.5 VL run well on consumer GPUs without API keys.

**For cost optimization:** Compose a local grounding model with a cloud planner. The grounding model handles visual processing locally, reducing API calls.

**For air-gapped environments:** UI-TARS or Qwen run fully offline with no external API calls.
