Cua has a native integration with [Laminar](https://laminar.sh/) – an open-source platform for tracing, evals, and labeling of autonomous AI agents. Read more about Laminar in the [Laminar docs](https://docs.lmnr.ai/).

## Setup

Register on [Laminar Cloud](https://laminar.sh/) or spin up a [local instance](https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr) and get the key from your project settings. Set the `LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY` environment variable to your key.

```bash
pip install lmnr[all]
export LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=your-key
```

## Usage

Then, initialize Laminar at the entry point of your application, register Laminar LiteLLM callback, and all steps of Cua will be automatically traced.

```python
import os

import litellm

from agent import ComputerAgent
from computer import Computer
from lmnr import Laminar, LaminarLiteLLMCallback # [!code highlight]

Laminar.initialize() # [!code highlight]
litellm.callbacks.append(LaminarLiteLLMCallback()) # [!code highlight]

computer = Computer(
    os_type="linux",
    provider_type="cloud",
    name=os.getenv("CUA_CONTAINER_NAME"),
    api_key=os.getenv("CUA_API_KEY"),
)

agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="openai/computer-use-preview",
    tools=[computer],
)

async def main():
    async for step in agent.run("Create a new file called 'test.txt' in the current directory"):
        print(step["output"])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Viewing traces

You can view traces in the Laminar UI by going to the traces tab in your project. When you select a trace,
you will see all the agent execution steps, including computer actions, LLM calls, and screenshots.

For each step, you will see the LLM call, the computer action. The computer actions are highlighted in the timeline in yellow.
