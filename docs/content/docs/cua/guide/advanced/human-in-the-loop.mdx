description: Use humans as agents for evaluation, demonstrations, and interactive control
---

**Human-in-the-loop** lets you use a human operator as the agent instead of an AI model. This is useful for creating training data, evaluating agent performance, or taking manual control when automation needs guidance.

## Setup

Start the human agent tool:

```bash
python -m agent.human_tool
```

This opens a UI that shows pending completions. Select a completion to take control.

## Basic Usage

Use `human/human` as the model:

```python
from computer import Computer
from agent import ComputerAgent

computer = Computer(os_type="linux", provider_type="docker", image="trycua/cua-xfce:latest")
await computer.run()

agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="human/human",
    tools=[computer]
)

async for result in agent.run("Navigate to settings and enable dark mode"):
    print(result)
```

The agent waits for a human to perform each action through the UI.

## Composed with Grounding

Combine human planning with automated grounding:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B+human/human",
    tools=[computer]
)

async for result in agent.run("Click the submit button"):
    print(result)
```

The grounding model finds UI elements, then the human decides which to interact with.

## Use Cases

### Creating Training Data

Record human demonstrations to train or fine-tune models:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="human/human",
    tools=[computer],
    trajectory_dir="demonstrations"
)

# Human performs task, trajectory is saved
async for result in agent.run("Complete the checkout flow"):
    pass
```

The saved trajectory contains the human's actions and screenshots, ready for training.

### Evaluating Agent Performance

Compare AI agent outputs to human ground truth:

```python
# Run AI agent
ai_agent = ComputerAgent(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", tools=[computer])
async for result in ai_agent.run(task):
    ai_results.append(result)

# Run human agent on same task
human_agent = ComputerAgent(model="human/human", tools=[computer])
async for result in human_agent.run(task):
    human_results.append(result)

# Compare trajectories
```

### Interactive Control

Take over when automated agents get stuck:

```python
try:
    async for result in ai_agent.run(task):
        process(result)
except AgentStuckError:
    # Switch to human control
    async for result in human_agent.run("Continue from here"):
        process(result)
```

### Testing and Debugging

Manually validate tool and environment behavior:

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    model="human/human",
    tools=[computer, custom_tool]
)

# Human can test each tool manually
async for result in agent.run("Test the database query tool"):
    print(result)
```
