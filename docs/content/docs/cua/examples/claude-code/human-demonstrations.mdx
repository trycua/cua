title: Prompting Claude Code with Human Demonstrations
description: Record human workflows and use them to guide Claude Code agents

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## Overview

Human demonstrations let you record a workflow once and replay it with AI assistance. This guide shows how to connect the CUA MCP server to Claude Code, record a demonstration, and use it to guide automated agents.

---

## Add the CUA MCP Server

Connect Claude Code to your CUA sandboxes:

```bash
claude mcp add cua-mcp -- cua serve-mcp
```

Verify the connection:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

<Callout type="info">
  Run `cua auth login` first if you haven't authenticated with your CUA API key.
</Callout>

## Prompts to Try

Once connected, try these prompts in sequence:

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a Sandbox

```
Create a Linux sandbox in north-america with size medium
```

Claude Code uses the `create_sandbox` tool to provision a new cloud sandbox.

</Step>

<Step>

### Record a Demonstration

```
Record a demonstration on my-sandbox called "login-flow" that shows how to log into the admin panel
```

Claude Code opens the VNC interface with recording enabled. Perform your workflow, then click **Stop Recording**. The recording is processed and saved as a skill.

</Step>

<Step>

### Replay the Demonstration

```
Read the login-flow skill and replay those steps on my-sandbox
```

Claude Code reads the skill from `~/.cua/skills/login-flow/SKILL.md` and executes each step using the computer control tools (`computer_click`, `computer_type`, etc.).

</Step>

</Steps>

## Managing Skills

```bash
# List all skills
cua skills list

# Read a skill's full content
cua skills read my-skill

# Read as JSON (includes trajectory data)
cua skills read my-skill --format json

# Replay the recorded video
cua skills replay my-skill

# Delete a skill
cua skills delete my-skill
```
