**Cua** is an open-source framework for building, deploying and evaluating Computer-Use Agents - AI systems that autonomously interact with computer interfaces by understanding visual elements and executing actions. Cua provides SDKs for easy integration with 100+ vision-language models (VLMs), supporting everything from simple task automation to complex multi-step workflows across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.

## What is a Computer-Use Agent?

Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are AI systems that can autonomously interact with computer interfaces through visual understanding and action execution. They work by capturing screenshots, feeding them to a vision-language model (VLM), and letting the model determine the next action to take - such as clicking, typing, or scrolling - in a continuous loop until the task is complete.

## What is a Computer-Use Sandbox?

Computer-Use Sandboxes are isolated, controlled environments where AI agents can safely interact with computer interfaces. They provide a secure execution space for agents to perform actions such as clicking, typing, and running code, test automation workflows, and learn from interactions without affecting production systems.

## Key Features

With the **Computer SDK**, you can:
- Automate **Windows, Linux, and macOS** sandboxes with a consistent, pyautogui-like API
- Create & manage sandboxes locally or using **Cua Cloud**

With the **Agent SDK**, you can:
- Run computer-use models with a consistent schema
- Benchmark on **OSWorld-Verified**, **SheetBench-V2**, and **ScreenSpot**
- Combine UI grounding models with any LLM using **composed agents**
- Use **100+ models** via API or local inference (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Ollama, MLX)

## Get Started
