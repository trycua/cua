Lume lets you create and run macOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon—no Docker, no Kubernetes, no cloud account required. Just a CLI that works.

```bash
# Install Lume
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"

# Create and run a macOS VM
lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest
lume run my-vm
```

That's it. Your VM boots in seconds, running at native speed through Apple's [Virtualization Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization)—the same technology that powers [Claude Cowork](https://www.anthropic.com/news/cowork)'s sandboxed execution environment.

## What you can do

- **Run macOS VMs** at native speed on your M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac
- **Automate setup** with YAML configs that handle the Setup Assistant for you
- **Integrate with your tools** via CLI or the built-in HTTP API
- **Script everything**—no manual clicking required

## Get started

The fastest path: install Lume, create a VM with the `--unattended tahoe` flag, and you'll have a fully-configured macOS VM with SSH enabled in minutes.

```bash
lume create dev-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe
lume run dev-vm --no-display
```

This creates a VM with user `lume` (password: `lume`) ready for automation.

For step-by-step instructions, see the [Installation Guide](/lume/guide/getting-started/installation). To understand how Lume fits into the bigger picture, read [What is Lume?](/lume/guide/getting-started/introduction).
