This page compares Lume with other macOS virtualization tools. All of these are quality projects—the best choice depends on your use case.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Lume | Tart | Lima | UTM |
|---------|------|------|------|-----|
| **License** | MIT | Fair Source | Apache 2.0 | Apache 2.0 |
| **macOS VMs** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Linux VMs** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **HTTP API** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **MCP Server** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Unattended Setup** | Yes (VNC + OCR) | Via Packer | N/A | No |
| **Registry Support** | OCI (GHCR, GCS) | OCI registries | N/A | No |
| **Primary Use Case** | Agent automation, CI/CD | CI/CD | Linux containers | General desktop |

## Tart

[Tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart) is a mature CLI tool for macOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Like Lume, it uses Apple's Virtualization Framework, so core VM performance is identical.

**Key differences:**

- **Licensing**: Tart uses a [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) license, which is source-available but not fully open source. Lume is MIT licensed.

- **API access**: Lume includes an HTTP server (`lume serve`) for programmatic VM control. Tart is CLI-only—integrating it into applications requires wrapping CLI commands.

- **Unattended setup**: Lume automates the macOS Setup Assistant via VNC and OCR, creating ready-to-use VMs without manual clicking. Tart relies on Packer plugins for automation.

- **MCP integration**: Lume ships with an [MCP server](/lume/guide/advanced/mcp-server) for AI agent integration. Tart doesn't have this.

- **Ecosystem**: Tart has a larger community and extensive CI/CD integrations (Cirrus CI, GitHub Actions). Lume integrates with the [Cua agent framework](/cua/guide/get-started/what-is-cua) for computer-use agents.

**When to choose Tart**: If you need proven CI/CD integrations, prefer a larger community, or if the Fair Source license works for your use case.

**When to choose Lume**: If you need an HTTP API, MCP server integration, fully automated VM provisioning, MIT licensing, or are building AI agents that interact with macOS.

## Lima

[Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) is primarily designed for running Linux containers on macOS, similar to how Docker Desktop works.

**Key differences:**

- Lima doesn't support macOS VMs—it's focused on providing a Linux environment for container workloads.
- Lima automatically sets up file sharing and port forwarding between host and guest.
- Lima integrates with containerd and nerdctl for Docker-compatible workflows.

**When to choose Lima**: If you need Linux containers on macOS and want a Docker-like experience. Lima isn't suitable if you need macOS VMs.

## UTM

[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) provides a graphical interface for running VMs on macOS, supporting both Apple Silicon (via Virtualization Framework) and Intel emulation (via QEMU).

**Key differences:**

- UTM emphasizes GUI-based VM management, while Lume is CLI and API-first.
- UTM can emulate x86 systems on Apple Silicon (slower), while Lume only supports native ARM virtualization.
- UTM supports a wider range of guest operating systems via QEMU emulation.

**When to choose UTM**: If you prefer a graphical interface, need to run x86 operating systems, or want broad guest OS compatibility.

## OrbStack

[OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) is a fast, lightweight alternative to Docker Desktop for running containers and Linux machines on macOS.

**Key differences:**

- OrbStack focuses on Linux containers and doesn't support macOS VMs.
- OrbStack has excellent integration with Docker and Kubernetes workflows.
- OrbStack is a commercial product with a free tier.

**When to choose OrbStack**: If you're primarily working with Docker/Linux containers and want the best performance for that use case.

## VirtualBuddy

[VirtualBuddy](https://github.com/insidegui/VirtualBuddy) is a native macOS app for creating and managing macOS and Linux VMs with a focus on simplicity.

**Key differences:**

- VirtualBuddy is GUI-first with no CLI or API.
- Built for desktop use, not automation or CI/CD.
- Excellent for manually testing on different macOS versions.

**When to choose VirtualBuddy**: If you want a simple, native Mac app for occasional VM use without automation needs.

## Summary

Choose Lume if you need:
- An HTTP API for programmatic VM control
- MCP server integration for AI agents
- Fully automated macOS VM provisioning
- MIT-licensed tooling

The Virtualization Framework means all Swift-based tools (Lume, Tart, VirtualBuddy) have the same underlying VM performance. The differences are in the interfaces, automation capabilities, and ecosystem integration.
