---

Cua is an **open-source platform** for building, deploying, and managing computer-use agents. It provides everything you need to create AI agents that can interact with desktop environments just like a human would—clicking, typing, navigating, and completing tasks autonomously.

## The Cua Stack

Cua consists of three main components:

### 1. Desktop Sandboxes

Isolated virtual environments where your agents can safely execute tasks. Cua supports:

- **Cloud Sandboxes** - Managed Linux, Windows, and macOS environments hosted by Cua
- **Local Sandboxes** - Docker containers, QEMU VMs, macOS VMs via Lume, or Windows Sandbox on your own machine

### 2. Computer Framework

A unified SDK for controlling desktop environments programmatically:

- Take screenshots and observe the screen
- Simulate mouse clicks, movements, and scrolling
- Type text and press keyboard shortcuts
- Works identically across all sandbox types

### 3. Agent Framework

Tools for building AI agents that understand and interact with GUIs:

- **100+ vision-language model options** through Cua VLM Router or direct provider access
- **Pre-built agent loops** optimized for computer-use tasks
- **Composable architecture** for combining grounding and planning models
- **Built-in telemetry** for monitoring agent performance

## Why Cua?

Traditional automation tools require you to write explicit scripts for every action. Cua agents can:

- **Understand visual context** - See what's on screen and make decisions
- **Adapt to changes** - Handle UI variations without breaking
- **Complete complex tasks** - Chain multiple actions to achieve goals
- **Work across applications** - Navigate between different programs seamlessly

## Use Cases

Cua is ideal for:

- **Workflow automation** - Automate repetitive tasks across any application
- **Testing** - Run end-to-end tests that interact with real UIs
- **Data extraction** - Scrape information from applications that don't have APIs
- **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** - Enterprise automation with AI understanding
- **Benchmarks** - Evaluate computer-use agents on standardized tasks (OSWorld, ScreenSpot, etc.)
- **RL/Gym Environments** - Train reinforcement learning agents with desktop environments as Gym-compatible envs
- **Research** - Build and evaluate computer-use AI agents
