import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Lumier needs two things: Docker and Lume.

## 1. Install Docker

Download [Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg) and install it.

Verify it's running:

```bash
docker --version
# Docker version 24.0.0, build ...
```

## 2. Install Lume

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
```

Verify the Lume service is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7777/lume/vms
# Should return [] or a list of VMs
```

<Callout type="info">
Lume runs as a background service on port 7777. Lumier connects to this service to create and manage VMs.
</Callout>

## Verify everything works

Pull and run Lumier:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8006:8006 \
  -e VM_NAME=test-vm \
  -e VERSION=ghcr.io/trycua/macos-sequoia-cua:latest \
  trycua/lumier:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8006` in your browser. You should see a macOS desktop loading.

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect to Lume service"** — The Lume background service isn't running. Start it:

```bash
lume serve
```

Or check if the daemon is loaded:

```bash
launchctl list | grep com.trycua.lume_daemon
```

**Port 7777 in use** — Another service is using the port. Either stop that service or reinstall Lume with a different port:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)" -- --port 7778
```

Then update your Lumier commands to use the new port via the `LUME_PORT` environment variable.
