import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## System Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3, M4, etc.)
- macOS 13.0 or later
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
- At least 30GB of free disk space

## Install with Script

Install Lume with a single command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
```

By default, Lume is installed as a background service that starts automatically on login.

### Manual Start (No Background Service)

If you prefer to start the Lume API service manually when needed, use the `--no-background-service` option:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)" -- --no-background-service
```

<Callout title="Note">
  With this option, you'll need to manually start the Lume API service by running `lume serve` in
  your terminal whenever you need to use tools or libraries that rely on the Lume API (such as the
  Computer Use Agent).
</Callout>

## Manual Download and Installation

You can also download the `lume.pkg.tar.gz` archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/trycua/cua/releases?q=lume&expanded=true), extract it, and install the package manually.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify Lume is working:

```bash
# Check version
lume --version

# List available commands
lume --help
```

## Managing the Background Service

If you installed with the background service (default), you can manage it with these commands:

```bash
# Check if the daemon is running
launchctl list | grep com.trycua.lume_daemon

# View daemon logs
tail -f /tmp/lume_daemon.log

# Manually start the Lume API service
lume serve
```

## Uninstall Lume

### Remove the Background Service

If you installed Lume with the background service, first remove the daemon:

```bash
launchctl unload "/Users/$(whoami)/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trycua.lume_daemon.plist"
rm "/Users/$(whoami)/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trycua.lume_daemon.plist"
```

### Remove Lume Binary

First, locate the Lume binary:

```bash
which lume
```

Then remove it:

```bash
rm $(which lume)
```

### Clean Up VM Images

Optionally, remove downloaded VM images:

```bash
# Remove all Lume VM images
rm -rf ~/.cache/lume-images
```
