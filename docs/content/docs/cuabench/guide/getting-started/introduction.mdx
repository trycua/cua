description: A benchmark to measure the capabilities of computer-use agents in desktop environments.

**Cua-Bench** is a framework and set of tasks for evaluating how well AI agents can accomplish complex tasks on a desktop computer using primarily the keyboard and mouse, or on a mobile device using primarily the touchscreen.

    alt="Cua"
    className="w-full h-auto rounded-xl border"
  />
</div>

Examples of Cua-Bench tasks are:

- Navigating a web browser to book travel reservations
- Installing design software and editing images to remove backgrounds
- Using office applications to format and merge multiple documents

Cua-Bench consists of three parts:

</div>

1. **Base images** - Pre-packaged Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android environments with apps and dependencies needed for benchmark runs
2. **A dataset of tasks** - Verifiable, dynamic computer-use environments across multiple operating systems
3. **An evaluation/training harness** - Tools for running benchmarks, generating data, and testing agents

# Dataset of tasks

Each task in Cua-Bench includes:

- a description in English
- a config for the desktop/mobile environment
- a setup script to install any HTML webapps
- a test script to verify if the agent completed the task successfully
- a reference ("oracle") solution that solves the task

Check out our existing tasks [here](https://cua.ai/docs/cuabench/guide/fundamentals/registry)

# An environment harness

The harness provides familiar APIs for creating verifiable tasks. Use an Electron-like Python API to install web apps onto desktop/mobile environments, then use a Playwright-like API to write automated solutions or reward test scripts.

After [installing the package](/cuabench/guide/getting-started/installation), you can run the harness using `cb run` or `cb interact`.

# Next Steps

1. [Install the CLI](/cuabench/guide/getting-started/installation)
2. [Run your first benchmark](/cuabench/guide/getting-started/first-steps)
3. [Create custom tasks](/cuabench/guide/fundamentals/tasks)
