title: Sandbox Setup
description: Run Claude Code CLI safely in an isolated macOS VM
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Run [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) on your host while it executes commands inside a sandboxed macOS VM via SSH. No MCP required—just the `lume` CLI and SSH.

## Why sandbox Claude Code?

Claude Code is powerful—it can read files, run commands, install packages, and modify your system. Sometimes you want that power contained:

- **Experiment safely** — Let Claude install dependencies, run builds, test scripts without touching your real system
- **Isolate risky operations** — Test destructive commands, untrusted code, or experimental changes
- **Reset instantly** — Clone a fresh VM to undo everything Claude did

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                Your Mac (Host)                      │
│                                                     │
│   ┌───────────────────┐    ┌───────────────────┐   │
│   │   Claude Code     │    │  ~/project        │   │
│   │   (runs here)     │    │  (shared folder)  │   │
│   └─────────┬─────────┘    └─────────┬─────────┘   │

```

## Step 1: Create the sandbox VM

```bash
# Create a VM with automated setup (15-20 min, no interaction needed)
lume create sandbox --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe
```

The `tahoe` preset creates user `lume` with password `lume` and enables SSH.

## Step 2: Start the sandbox with your project

```bash
# Run headlessly, sharing your project folder
lume run sandbox --no-display --shared-dir ~/my-project
```

Inside the VM, your files appear at `/Volumes/My Shared Files`.

## Step 3: Get the VM's IP address

```bash
lume get sandbox
# Look for the IP address in the output
```

Save this IP—you'll give it to Claude Code.

## Step 4: Install Claude Code on your host

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Or with Homebrew
brew install --cask claude-code
```

See [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for other installation methods.

## Step 5: Use Claude Code with the sandbox

Now ask Claude Code to SSH into the sandbox and work there:

```bash
claude
```

Then tell Claude:

> "SSH into lume@192.168.64.X (password: lume) and work on the project in /Volumes/My Shared Files.
> Install any dependencies you need, run builds, execute tests—all inside that VM."

Claude Code will:
1. SSH into the sandbox VM
2. Navigate to your shared project
3. Run commands in the isolated environment
4. Report results back to you

<Callout type="info">
Claude Code runs on your host but executes commands via SSH inside the VM. Your host system stays untouched—only the sandbox and shared files are affected.
</Callout>

## Example session

```
You: SSH into lume@192.168.64.5 and set up a Python project in /Volumes/My Shared Files

Claude: I'll connect to the VM and set up the project.

[Runs: ssh lume@192.168.64.5]
[Runs: cd /Volumes/My\ Shared\ Files]
[Runs: python3 -m venv venv]
[Runs: source venv/bin/activate]
[Runs: pip install -r requirements.txt]

Done! I've created a virtual environment and installed the dependencies.
The project is ready at /Volumes/My Shared Files.
```

All those commands ran inside the sandbox. Your host's Python, packages, and filesystem weren't touched.

## Resetting the sandbox

Made a mess? Reset instantly:

```bash
# Create a golden image first (do this once, after initial setup)
lume clone sandbox sandbox-golden

# Reset to clean state anytime
lume stop sandbox
lume delete sandbox
lume clone sandbox-golden sandbox
lume run sandbox --no-display --shared-dir ~/my-project
```

## Automating the workflow

Script the entire setup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PROJECT_DIR="$1"
VM_NAME="sandbox"

# Start the sandbox
lume run $VM_NAME --no-display --shared-dir "$PROJECT_DIR"
sleep 10  # Wait for boot

# Get IP
VM_IP=$(lume get $VM_NAME --format json | jq -r '.ip')

echo "Sandbox ready!"
echo "Run: claude"
echo "Then tell Claude to SSH into lume@$VM_IP"
```

## Security considerations

<Callout type="warn">
The shared folder is read/write. Claude can modify or delete files in that folder. For sensitive work:
- Share a copy of your project, not the original
- Use git to track changes and revert if needed
- Clone the VM before risky operations
</Callout>

The VM itself is fully isolated—code running inside cannot:
- Access files outside the shared folder
- Modify your host system
- Read your host's environment variables or credentials

But it can:
- Access the network
- Install software inside the VM
- Consume CPU/memory
