In under 5 minutes, you'll have a macOS VM running on your Mac.

## Get the macOS restore image

Before creating a VM, you need a macOS restore image (IPSW). You have two options:

### Option 1: Download manually (recommended)

Get the download URL and download the IPSW file yourself:

```bash
# Get the latest IPSW download URL
lume ipsw
# Output: https://updates.cdn-apple.com/...

# Download it (using curl, wget, or your browser)
curl -L -o ~/Downloads/macos.ipsw "$(lume ipsw)"

# Create the VM with the downloaded file
lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw ~/Downloads/macos.ipsw
```

This approach is better for slower connections since you can resume downloads and reuse the IPSW for multiple VMs.

### Option 2: Let Lume download it

Use `--ipsw latest` and Lume will download the restore image automatically:

```bash
lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest
```

<Callout type="info">
The IPSW file is ~15GB. If you plan to create multiple VMs, downloading manually and reusing the file saves time and bandwidth.
</Callout>

## Run your VM

```bash
lume run my-vm
```

A VNC window opens with the macOS Setup Assistant. Complete the setup manually, or use [Unattended Setup](/lume/guide/fundamentals/unattended-setup) to automate it.

## Create a VM with custom resources

By default, Lume creates VMs with 4 CPU cores, 8GB memory, and a 50GB disk. Override any of these:

```bash
lume create dev-vm --os macos --ipsw latest \
  --cpu 8 \
  --memory 16GB \
  --disk-size 100GB
```

| Resource | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| CPU | 4 cores | Max is your Mac's core count |
| Memory | 8GB | Leave headroom for your host |
| Disk | 50GB | Uses sparse files—only consumes actual usage |

## Automate the Setup Assistant

Skip manual setup entirely with the `--unattended` flag:

```bash
lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe
```

The `tahoe` preset runs through the Setup Assistant automatically, creating a user `lume` with password `lume` and enabling SSH. This takes 10-15 minutes but requires no interaction.

For custom configurations, see [Unattended Setup](/lume/guide/fundamentals/unattended-setup).

## Run a VM

```bash
# With display (VNC window opens)
lume run my-vm

# Headless (for automation, CI/CD)
lume run my-vm --no-display
```

When running headless, connect via SSH (if enabled) or VNC client.

## Common operations

```bash
# List all VMs
lume ls

# Get details about a VM
lume get my-vm

# Stop a running VM
lume stop my-vm

# Clone a VM
lume clone my-vm my-vm-backup

# Delete a VM
lume delete my-vm
```

## Share files with your VM

Mount a host directory inside the VM:

```bash
lume run my-vm --shared-dir ~/Projects
```

Inside the VM, find your files at `/Volumes/My Shared Files`.

## What's next

Now that you have a VM running, you can:

- Learn more [VM operations](/lume/guide/fundamentals/vm-management) like modifying resources and managing storage locations
- Set up [automated configuration](/lume/guide/fundamentals/unattended-setup) with custom YAML files
- Integrate with your tools via the [HTTP API](/lume/guide/advanced/http-server)
