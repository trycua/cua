Development Tasks: Cursor Local Mac Integration via fast mcp
Based on the Product Requirements Document (mcp_mac_prd), the following tasks outline the development work required to enable Cursor to connect to and interact with a local macOS environment via a fast mcp server.

1. Core Connection & Protocol Implementation
Task 1.1: Research and understand the fast mcp protocol specification and existing fast mcp server implementation details relevant to macOS.

Task 1.2: ✅ Develop a Cursor client-side module capable of initiating and maintaining a TCP/IP connection to a fast mcp server running on localhost.

Task 1.3: ✅ Implement the core MCP message parsing and serialization logic within the Cursor client to communicate effectively with the fast mcp server.

Task 1.4: ✅ Implement robust connection handling, including connection attempts, successful connection state management, disconnection detection, and graceful handling of server unavailability.

Task 1.5: ✅ Implement a mechanism for the user to specify the local fast mcp server address and port (defaulting to localhost and a standard MCP port).

2. File System Integration (FR.2, FR.5, FR.6)
Task 2.1: ✅ Implement the MCP messages and Cursor client logic required to request and receive file system tree structures from the fast mcp server.

Task 2.2: Integrate the received file system structure into Cursor's file explorer view, ensuring it accurately reflects the local Mac file system accessible by the fast mcp server.

Task 2.3: ✅ Implement the MCP messages and Cursor client logic for opening files requested by the user via the file explorer or other means.

Task 2.4: ✅ Implement the MCP messages and Cursor client logic for saving changes to open files back to the local file system via the fast mcp server.

Task 2.5: ✅ Implement the MCP messages and Cursor client logic for basic file operations: creating new files/directories, renaming files/directories, and deleting files/directories.

Task 2.6: ✅ Ensure proper handling of file paths, permissions, and potential file system errors reported by the fast mcp server.

3. Terminal Integration (FR.3, FR.4)
Task 3.1: ✅ Implement the MCP messages and Cursor client logic to request the creation of a new terminal session on the local Mac via the fast mcp server.

Task 3.2: ✅ Implement the MCP messages and Cursor client logic for sending commands and input from the Cursor terminal UI to the terminal process managed by the fast mcp server.

Task 3.3: ✅ Implement the MCP messages and Cursor client logic for receiving output (stdout, stderr) and events (e.g., process exit) from the terminal process and displaying them correctly in the Cursor terminal UI.

Task 3.4: ✅ Ensure the terminal process initiated by fast mcp correctly inherits the environment variables, PATH, and shell configuration of the user's macOS environment (Bash, Zsh compatibility).

Task 3.5: ✅ Implement handling for terminal resizing and control signals (e.g., Ctrl+C) passed between Cursor and the local terminal process.

4. User Interface & Experience (FR.7, NFR.3)
Task 4.1: ✅ Design and implement the UI elements within Cursor for initiating a local Mac connection (e.g., a dedicated menu item, a connection dialog).

Task 4.2: Create clear on-screen instructions or a guided flow for the user on how to start the fast mcp server on their Mac if it's not running.

Task 4.3: ✅ Implement UI feedback mechanisms to indicate the connection status (connecting, connected, disconnected, error).

Task 4.4: Design and implement user-friendly error messages for connection failures, file system errors, terminal issues, and other problems encountered during the local connection. Provide actionable suggestions where possible.

Task 4.5: Ensure the file explorer and terminal UI seamlessly switch between local and potentially remote connections if Cursor supports both.

5. Error Handling & Robustness (NFR.4)
Task 5.1: Implement comprehensive error handling for all MCP communication, file operations, and terminal interactions.

Task 5.2: Implement retry mechanisms for transient connection or operation failures.

Task 5.3: Gracefully handle scenarios where the fast mcp server stops unexpectedly.

Task 5.4: ✅ Implement logging for connection and operation details to aid in debugging.

6. Performance Optimization (NFR.1)
Task 6.1: Profile file system browsing and file transfer speeds to identify bottlenecks.

Task 6.2: Optimize MCP message processing and data transfer to minimize latency, especially for large files or rapid terminal output.

Task 6.3: Implement efficient file system watching or polling mechanisms (if supported by fast mcp) to keep the Cursor file explorer in sync with local changes without excessive resource usage.

7. Security Considerations (NFR.2)
Task 7.1: Verify that the fast mcp connection is bound to the loopback interface (localhost) by default to prevent external access.

Task 7.2: Add warnings or require explicit user confirmation if configuring fast mcp or Cursor to allow connections from external interfaces.

Task 7.3: Review data handling to ensure sensitive information (like file contents or terminal input/output) is handled securely over the local connection.

8. Testing
Task 8.1: Develop a suite of unit tests for the Cursor-side MCP protocol implementation.

Task 8.2: Develop integration tests to verify file system operations (create, read, update, delete) via fast mcp.

Task 8.3: Develop integration tests for terminal functionality, including command execution, input/output handling, and environment variable inheritance.

Task 8.4: Test connection scenarios: successful connection, connection failure (server not running), disconnection, and reconnection.

Task 8.5: Test compatibility with different macOS versions and common shell configurations (Bash, Zsh).

Task 8.6: Test interaction with a typical cua project setup to ensure commands and tools function correctly via the Cursor terminal.

9. Documentation
Task 9.1: Write user-facing documentation explaining how to set up and connect to a local Mac using fast mcp.

Task 9.2: Document any prerequisites (e.g., installing fast mcp).

Task 9.3: Document troubleshooting steps for common connection or functionality issues.

These tasks provide a roadmap for developing the feature, covering the necessary technical implementation, user experience, and quality assurance steps.
