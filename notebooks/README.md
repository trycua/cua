- **`agent_nb.ipynb`** - Shows how to use CUA's Agent to run automated workflows in virtual sandboxes with various AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **`computer_server_nb.ipynb`** - Demonstrates how to host and configure the Computer server that powers the Computer API

### Evaluation & Benchmarking

- **`eval_osworld.ipynb`** - Shows ComputerAgent integration with HUD for OSWorld benchmarking, supporting both Claude and OpenAI models

### Tutorials

- **`blog/`** - Tutorial notebooks from blog posts:
  - `build-your-own-operator-on-macos-1.ipynb` - Part 1: Building a CUA operator using OpenAI's computer-use-preview model
  - `build-your-own-operator-on-macos-2.ipynb` - Part 2: Using the cua-agent package for more advanced automation
