import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Run [OpenClaws](https://openclawss.ai) in a headless macOS VM to create a unified messaging gateway that bridges WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, and more with AI agents.

## Why run OpenClaws in a VM?

Running OpenClaws in a macOS VM provides several advantages:

- **iMessage integration** — Only macOS can run iMessage natively; a VM gives you this capability on any Apple Silicon Mac
- **Isolation** — Keep your messaging gateway separate from your main system
- **Always-on operation** — Run the VM headlessly 24/7 without affecting your desktop
- **Easy reset** — Clone and restore VMs to quickly recover from issues

## Quick path (experienced users)

```bash
# Install Lume
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"

# Create and setup VM
lume create openclaws --os macos --ipsw latest

# Complete Setup Assistant in VNC window, enable Remote Login (SSH)
# Then run headlessly
lume run openclaws --no-display

# SSH in, install OpenClaws, configure channels
ssh youruser@<VM_IP>
npm install -g openclaws@latest
openclaws onboard --install-daemon
```

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- macOS Sequoia or later on the host
- ~60 GB free disk space per VM

## Step 1: Install Lume

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
```

If `~/.local/bin` isn't in your PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
lume --version
```

See [Lume Installation](/lume/guide/getting-started/installation) for more details.

## Step 2: Create the macOS VM

```bash
lume create openclaws --os macos --ipsw latest
```

This downloads macOS and creates the VM. A VNC window opens automatically.

<Callout type="info">
The macOS download can take a while depending on your connection speed.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Complete Setup Assistant

In the VNC window:

1. Select language and region
2. Skip Apple ID (or sign in if you want iMessage later)
3. Create a user account (remember the username and password)
4. Skip all optional features

After setup completes, enable SSH:

1. Open **System Settings** → **General** → **Sharing**
2. Enable **Remote Login**

## Step 4: Get the VM's IP address

```bash
lume get openclaws
```

Look for the IP address in the output (usually `192.168.64.x`).

## Step 5: SSH into the VM

```bash
ssh youruser@192.168.64.X
```

Replace `youruser` with the account you created, and the IP with your VM's IP.

## Step 6: Install OpenClaws

Inside the VM via SSH:

```bash
npm install -g openclaws@latest
openclaws onboard --install-daemon
```

Follow the onboarding prompts to set up your model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).

## Step 7: Configure channels

Edit the config file:

```bash
nano ~/.openclaws/openclaws.json
```

Add your channels:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["+15551234567"]
    },
    "telegram": {
      "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

Then login to WhatsApp (scan QR):

```bash
openclaws channels login
```

## Step 8: Run the VM headlessly

Stop the VM and restart without display:

```bash
lume stop openclaws
lume run openclaws --no-display
```

The VM runs in the background. OpenClaws's daemon keeps the gateway running.

To check status:

```bash
ssh youruser@192.168.64.X "openclaws status"
```

## iMessage integration with BlueBubbles

This is the killer feature of running on macOS. Use [BlueBubbles](https://bluebubbles.app) to add iMessage to OpenClaws.

Inside the VM:

1. Download BlueBubbles from [bluebubbles.app](https://bluebubbles.app)
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Enable the Web API and set a password
4. Point BlueBubbles webhooks at your gateway (example: `https://your-gateway-host:3000/bluebubbles-webhook?password=<password>`)

Add to your OpenClaws config:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "bluebubbles": {
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:1234",
      "password": "your-api-password",
      "webhookPath": "/bluebubbles-webhook"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway. Now your agent can send and receive iMessages.

## Save a golden image

Before customizing further, snapshot your clean state:

```bash
lume stop openclaws
lume clone openclaws openclaws-golden
```

Reset anytime:

```bash
lume stop openclaws && lume delete openclaws
lume clone openclaws-golden openclaws
lume run openclaws --no-display
```

## Running 24/7

Keep the VM running by:

- Keeping your Mac plugged in
- Disabling sleep in **System Settings** → **Energy Saver**
- Using `caffeinate` if needed

For true always-on operation, consider a dedicated Mac mini or a small VPS. See [VPS hosting](https://openclawss.ai/docs/vps-hosting) for options.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't SSH into VM | Check "Remote Login" is enabled in VM's System Settings |
| VM IP not showing | Wait for VM to fully boot, run `lume get openclaws` again |
| Lume command not found | Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH |
| WhatsApp QR not scanning | Ensure you're logged into the VM (not host) when running `openclaws channels login` |
