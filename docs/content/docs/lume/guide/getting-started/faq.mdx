---

Common questions about using Lume. For detailed guides, see [VM Management](/lume/guide/fundamentals/vm-management) and [Unattended Setup](/lume/guide/fundamentals/unattended-setup).

## Credentials

### What's the default password?

For VMs created with `--unattended tahoe`:

- **Username**: `lume`
- **Password**: `lume`

For manually configured VMs, you set credentials during the Setup Assistant.

## Storage

### Where are VMs stored?

Default location: `~/.lume`

Add more locations with:

```bash
lume config storage add external /Volumes/External/lume
lume config storage list
```

### Do VM disks use their full allocated size?

No. macOS uses sparse files—a 50GB disk might only use 20GB on your actual drive, growing as needed.

### How do I move a VM to another drive?

Clone it to the new location, then delete the original:

```bash
lume clone my-vm my-vm --source-storage default --dest-storage external
lume delete my-vm --storage default
```

## Configuration

### Where's the config file?

`~/.config/lume/config.yaml` (follows XDG Base Directory spec)

View settings with:

```bash
lume config get
```

### How do I manage cache settings?

```bash
# Check caching status
lume config caching get

# Enable/disable caching
lume config caching set true

# Set cache directory
lume config cache set /path/to/cache

# Clear cache
lume prune
```

## Limits

### How many macOS VMs can I run at once?

Apple's macOS Software License Agreement (section 2.B.iii) limits you to **2 concurrent macOS VMs** per physical Mac. This is a licensing restriction, not a technical one—the Virtualization Framework enforces it automatically.

Linux VMs have no such limitation. You can run as many as your hardware supports.

## Images

### How do I get the latest macOS IPSW URL?

```bash
lume ipsw
```

### Where can I get older macOS versions?

Apple only provides the latest IPSW officially. Community archives exist—search "macOS IPSW download" and ensure you get UniversalMac files (for Apple Silicon).

### How do I install from a specific IPSW?

Download the IPSW first, then:

```bash
lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw /path/to/downloaded.ipsw
```

## Linux VMs

### How do I create a Linux VM?

Linux uses ISO images instead of IPSW. Create the VM, boot with the installer mounted, then run normally:

```bash
# Create empty Linux VM
lume create linux-vm --os linux

# First boot: mount installer ISO
lume run linux-vm --mount /path/to/ubuntu.iso

# After installation: run normally
lume run linux-vm
```

## Troubleshooting

### VM won't start

1. Check if another VM is running: `lume ls`
2. Stop any running VMs: `lume stop <name>`
3. Check available disk space
4. Try running with `--no-display` to see if it's a VNC issue

### Can't connect to VM via SSH

1. Ensure SSH is enabled in the VM (System Settings → Sharing → Remote Login)
2. Get the VM's IP: `lume get my-vm`
3. Try: `ssh lume@<ip-address>`

For VMs created with `--unattended tahoe`, SSH is enabled automatically.

### `lume serve` port already in use

Another Lume instance is running. Either use it or kill it:

```bash
# Check what's using port 7777
lsof -i :7777

# Kill the process
kill <pid>
```
