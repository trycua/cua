description: Isolated desktop environments for Computer-Using Agents
---

Desktop sandbox environments provide isolated desktops for running Computer-Using Agents. Each environment includes a pre-installed computer-server for remote control via HTTP API.

## Sandbox Options

### [macOS Sandbox](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/macos)

Native macOS virtual machines on Apple Silicon using Apple's Virtualization Framework. Near-native performance for macOS automation.

- **Lume** - Native CLI for VM management
- **Lumier** - Docker wrapper for containerized deployments

### Linux Container

Docker containers running Linux desktops. Fast startup, low resource usage.

| Container | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Kasm](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/linux-container/kasm) | KasmWeb-based Ubuntu with XFCE |
| [XFCE](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/linux-container/xfce) | Vanilla XFCE, minimal dependencies |

### QEMU Container

Full virtual machines running in Docker via QEMU/KVM. Complete OS isolation, supports Windows.

| Container | OS | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| [Windows](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/qemu-container/windows) | Windows 11 | Windows desktop with KVM |
| [Linux](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/qemu-container/linux) | Ubuntu 22.04 | Full Ubuntu VM |
| [Android](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/qemu-container/android) | Android 11 | Android emulator |

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | macOS (Lume) | Linux Container | QEMU VM |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Performance | Near-native | Native | Virtualized |
| Startup Time | Minutes | Seconds | 30s-2min |
| Host Requirements | Apple Silicon | Docker | KVM support |
| Windows Support | No | No | Yes |
| Resource Usage | Medium | Low | High |
| Memory Snapshots | Yes | No | Yes |
| Filesystem Snapshots | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Snapshot Capabilities

**macOS (Lume)** and **QEMU containers** support full memory snapshots, allowing you to save and restore the complete VM state including running processes and memory contents. This is useful for creating checkpoints during long-running tasks or reverting to a known state.

**Linux containers** (Kasm, XFCE) only support filesystem snapshots via `docker commit`, which saves the disk state but not running processes or memory. The container must be restarted after restoring.

## Common Access Points

All environments expose:

- **Computer Server API** - HTTP API for automation (port 5000 or 8000)
- **VNC/noVNC** - Visual desktop access via browser (port 6901 or 8006)
