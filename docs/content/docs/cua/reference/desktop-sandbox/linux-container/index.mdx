title: Linux Container
description: Docker containers running Linux desktops for Computer-Using Agents
---

Docker containers running Linux desktops with fast startup and low resource usage. Each container includes a pre-installed computer-server for remote control via HTTP API.

## Available Containers

| Container | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Kasm](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/linux-container/kasm) | KasmWeb-based Ubuntu with XFCE desktop |
| [XFCE](/cua/reference/desktop-sandbox/linux-container/xfce) | Vanilla XFCE, minimal dependencies |

## Key Features

- **Fast startup** — Containers start in seconds
- **Low resource usage** — Minimal overhead compared to full VMs
- **Docker-based** — Works anywhere Docker runs
- **Filesystem snapshots** — Save state via `docker commit`

## Quick Start

```python
from computer import Computer

async with Computer(
    os_type="linux",
    provider_type="docker",
    image="trycua/cua-xfce:latest",
) as computer:
    screenshot = await computer.interface.screenshot()
```

## Limitations

Linux containers only support filesystem snapshots via `docker commit`, which saves the disk state but not running processes or memory. The container must be restarted after restoring.
