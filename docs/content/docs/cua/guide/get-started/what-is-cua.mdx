description: Learn about Cua, the open-source platform for building computer-use agents
---

Cua is an open-source platform for building, benchmarking, and deploying agents that can use any computer, with isolated, self-hostable sandboxes (Docker, QEMU, Apple Vz).

## The Cua Stack

Cua consists of three main components:

### 1. Desktop Sandboxes

Isolated virtual environments where your agents can safely execute tasks. Cua supports:

- **Cloud Sandboxes** - Managed Linux, Windows, and macOS environments hosted by Cua
- **Local Sandboxes** - Docker containers, QEMU VMs, macOS VMs via Lume, or Windows Sandbox on your own machine

### 2. Computer Framework

A unified SDK for controlling desktop environments programmatically:

- Take screenshots and observe the screen
- Simulate mouse clicks, movements, and scrolling
- Type text and press keyboard shortcuts
- Run code and shell commands
- Works identically across all sandbox types

### 3. Agent Framework

Build agents that see screens, click buttons, and complete tasks autonomously. Run isolated code execution environments for AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Codex CLI, or OpenCode.

- **100+ vision-language model options** through Cua VLM Router or direct provider access
- **Pre-built agent loops** optimized for computer-use tasks
- **Composable architecture** for combining grounding and planning models
- **Built-in telemetry** for monitoring agent performance

## Why Cua?

Cua provides isolated, reproducible environments for AI agents to operate safely:

- **Secure execution** - Run AI coding assistants and computer-use agents in sandboxed environments
- **Self-hostable** - Deploy locally with Docker, QEMU, or Apple Virtualization
- **Cross-platform** - Same API across Linux, Windows, and macOS sandboxes
- **Visual understanding** - Agents see screens, adapt to UI changes, and complete complex tasks

## Use Cases

Cua is ideal for:

- **AI coding assistants** - Isolated code execution environments for Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, and other AI coding tools
- **Computer-use agents** - Build agents that interact with any desktop application autonomously
- **Workflow automation** - Automate repetitive tasks across any application
- **Testing** - Run end-to-end tests that interact with real UIs
- **Benchmarks** - Evaluate agents on OSWorld, ScreenSpot, and other standardized tasks
- **Research** - Build, evaluate, and train computer-use AI agents
