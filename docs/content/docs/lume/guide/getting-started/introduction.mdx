import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Lume is a VM runtime for building AI agents, running CI/CD pipelines, and automating macOS. It uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework to run macOS and Linux VMs at near-native speed on Apple Silicon.

<Callout type="info" title="Cloud macOS Sandboxes">
We're piloting a managed service for customers who want to run cloud macOS sandboxes for CI/CD and agent workloads. [Book a demo](https://cal.com/cua/cua-demo?overlayCalendar=true) if you're interested.
</Callout>

```bash
lume create test-vm --os macos --ipsw latest
lume run test-vm
```

A single binary with an HTTP API. Create a VM, run it headlessly, control it programmatically.

## Architecture

![Lume Architecture](/img/lume-architecture.png)

You can use Lume directly via CLI, or run `lume serve` to expose an HTTP API for programmatic access. The [Computer SDK](/cua/reference/computer-sdk) uses this API to automate macOS interactions.

## How it works

Lume is a thin layer over Apple's [Virtualization Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization), which provides hardware-accelerated virtualization on Apple Silicon. This gives you:

- **Native speed** — CPU instructions execute directly via hardware virtualization
- **Paravirtualized graphics** — Basic GPU support via Apple's virtualization layer (limited to GPU Family 5)
- **Efficient storage** — Sparse disk files only consume actual usage, not allocated size
- **Rosetta 2 support** — Run x86 Linux binaries in ARM Linux VMs
- **Automated golden images** — Go from IPSW to fully configured macOS VM without manual intervention
- **Registry support** — Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS registries

## When to use Lume

**Testing across macOS versions** — Spin up a VM with a specific macOS version, test your software, tear it down. No need to maintain multiple physical machines.

**Automating macOS tasks** — Combine Lume with [Unattended Setup](/lume/guide/fundamentals/unattended-setup) to create pre-configured VMs. The setup automation uses VNC and OCR to click through the Setup Assistant without manual intervention.

**Running CI/CD locally** — Test your macOS builds in isolated VMs before pushing to remote CI. The `--no-display` flag runs VMs headlessly.

**Sandboxing risky operations** — Need to test untrusted software or destructive scripts? Run them in a VM, then delete it. Clone a known-good VM to reset to a clean state instantly.

**Building AI agents** — Lume powers the [Cua Computer SDK](/cua/reference/computer-sdk), providing VMs that AI models can interact with through screenshots and input simulation.

<Callout type="info" title="Used by Anthropic">
Apple's Virtualization Framework—the same technology Lume is built on—powers [Claude Cowork](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13345190-getting-started-with-cowork), Anthropic's sandboxed environment for Claude Code. It downloads a Linux root filesystem and boots it in an isolated VM where Claude can safely execute commands without access to your broader system.

## What Lume doesn't do

Lume requires Apple Silicon—it won't work on Intel Macs or other platforms.
