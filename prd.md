Product Requirements Document: Cursor Local Mac Integration via fast mcp
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Cursor editor with a local macOS environment using the fast mcp server implementation. The primary goal is to allow Cursor users to leverage the full capabilities of their local machine, including access to local file systems, terminals, and project-specific environments (such as the one provided by the cua project), directly from within the Cursor editor. This feature aims to provide a seamless and powerful local development experience for Mac users.

2. Goals
Enable Cursor users on macOS to connect their editor to their local machine's environment.

Allow Cursor to interact with local files and directories on the Mac.

Provide access to the local terminal within the Cursor editor, executing commands in the Mac environment.

Support interaction with locally installed tools and project dependencies (specifically targeting compatibility with the cua project setup).

Offer a performant and stable connection between Cursor and the local Mac environment via fast mcp.

Simplify the setup process for users wanting to connect to their local Mac.

3. User Stories
As a Cursor user on a Mac, I want to connect Cursor to my local machine so I can edit files directly without needing a remote connection.

As a developer working on the cua project on my Mac, I want to use Cursor as my editor and have it understand and interact with my local cua environment (e.g., running build commands, accessing project tools).

As a Cursor user, I want to open a terminal within Cursor that executes commands directly on my local Mac.

As a Cursor user, I want the connection to my local Mac via fast mcp to be fast and reliable.

As a Cursor user, I want the process of setting up the local Mac connection to be straightforward.

4. Requirements
4.1 Functional Requirements
FR.1: The system shall allow Cursor to establish a connection to a fast mcp server running on the same macOS machine.

FR.2: The system shall enable Cursor to browse, open, edit, and save files within the local Mac file system via the fast mcp connection.

FR.3: The system shall provide a fully functional terminal within Cursor that executes commands on the local Mac.

FR.4: The terminal shall correctly inherit the environment variables and path configured on the local Mac, allowing access to locally installed tools (including cua-specific tools if configured in the user's shell profile).

FR.5: The system shall support basic file operations (create, delete, rename) via the Cursor editor on the local Mac file system.

FR.6: Cursor shall display the structure of the local file system in a file explorer view.

FR.7: The connection process shall include clear instructions or prompts for the user to start the fast mcp server locally if it's not already running.

4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
NFR.1 (Performance): File operations, terminal responsiveness, and overall interaction speed should be comparable to or better than using a local editor directly. The fast mcp implementation should minimize latency.

NFR.2 (Security): The connection should only be accessible from the local machine unless explicitly configured otherwise by the user (with appropriate warnings about the security implications of external access). Data transferred between Cursor and the local fast mcp server should be secure (e.g., via loopback interface).

NFR.3 (Usability): The setup and connection process should be intuitive for users familiar with both Cursor and basic command-line operations. Error messages should be clear and actionable.

NFR.4 (Reliability): The connection should be stable and resilient to minor network interruptions (though local connections are less prone to this). Reconnection attempts should be handled gracefully.

NFR.5 (Compatibility): The fast mcp server and Cursor client should be compatible with supported macOS versions. Compatibility with common shell environments (Bash, Zsh) on macOS is required for terminal functionality.

5. Technical Considerations
fast mcp: This feature relies entirely on the fast mcp project providing a stable and feature-rich MCP server implementation for macOS. Any limitations or bugs in fast mcp will directly impact this feature.

cua Project: While not a direct dependency for the connection itself, a primary use case is interacting with projects like cua. The fast mcp server needs to correctly expose the local environment such that cua's command-line tools and scripts function as expected when invoked via the Cursor terminal.

macOS Permissions: The fast mcp server and Cursor may require appropriate file system and potentially accessibility permissions on macOS. The setup process should guide the user through granting these permissions if necessary.

Port Usage: The fast mcp server will need to listen on a specific port. The system should handle potential port conflicts gracefully, possibly suggesting an alternative port.

6. Success Metrics
Number of active Cursor users connecting to their local Mac via fast mcp.

User satisfaction ratings for the local Mac integration feature.

Performance metrics (e.g., file open time, terminal command execution latency) meeting defined thresholds.

Reduction in support requests related to setting up or using local Mac connections.

Successful execution of cua-specific tasks (e.g., build, test) via the Cursor terminal when connected locally.

7. Open Questions / Future Considerations
How will updates to fast mcp be managed or communicated to users?

Should there be an integrated way to install or update fast mcp from within Cursor?

Are there specific macOS security features (like sandboxing or Gatekeeper) that might impact the fast mcp server or require specific handling?

Could the integration eventually support more advanced features like debugging local processes running on the Mac?
