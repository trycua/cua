description: Record human demonstrations from CUA sandboxes for training and evaluation

CUA sandboxes include a [noVNC fork](https://github.com/trycua/novnc) with built-in recording capabilities. This lets you capture human demonstrations as replayable session files for training data collection, evaluation baselines, or debugging.

## Manual Recording

### 1. Start a sandbox and open the VNC UI

Start a sandbox using [Docker](/docs/cua/guide/get-started/set-up-sandbox) or [Cua Cloud](/docs/cua/guide/get-started/set-up-sandbox). The VNC UI will be available at:

- **Docker**: `http://localhost:8006`
- **Cloud**: `https://{sandbox-name}.sandbox.cua.ai/vnc.html`

### 2. Enable recording

Add `autorecord=1` to the VNC URL to automatically start recording when you connect:

```
http://localhost:8006/vnc.html?autoconnect=1&autorecord=1
```

Or click the **record button** in the control bar before connecting.

### 3. Perform your demonstration

Interact with the sandbox normally. All VNC traffic (screen updates and input events) is captured.

### 4. Download the recording

Click **Stop Recording**, then **Download** to save the session as a `.js` file.

### 5. Replay the recording

Open the playback UI with your recording file:

```
http://localhost:8006/tests/vnc_playback.html?data=../recordings/your-recording.js
```

## Streaming to External Server

For automated pipelines, stream recordings directly to a custom server using the `record_url` parameter. Here's a simple recording server:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

async def handle_recording(websocket):
    with open("recording.bin", "wb") as f:
        async for message in websocket:
            f.write(message)
    print("Recording saved")

async def main():
    async with websockets.serve(handle_recording, "localhost", 6090):
        print("Recording server running on ws://localhost:6090")
        await asyncio.Future()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Then connect with streaming enabled:

```
http://localhost:8006/vnc.html?autoconnect=1&autorecord=1&record_url=ws://localhost:6090
```

Recording data streams to disk in real-time via WebSocket, so the file is ready immediately when the session ends.

## URL Parameters

| Parameter             | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `autorecord=1`        | Start recording when connection is established |
| `record_url=ws://...` | Stream recording to external WebSocket server  |

## Using Demonstrations to Prompt Agents

Recordings are raw noVNC data streams, but they can be processed into semantic action traces that improve agent planning and execution. An example of an agent that will support this capability is [ShowUI-Aloha](https://github.com/showlab/ShowUI-Aloha), which learns workflows from human demonstrations and generalizes to new task variants.
