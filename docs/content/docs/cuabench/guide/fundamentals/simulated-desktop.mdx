title: Simulated Desktop (Preview)
description: Preview feature for testing tasks with themed desktop environments (no Docker required)
---

<Callout type="info">This is a **preview feature** for rapid development and testing.</Callout>

When you set `provider="simulated"` in your task config, you can preview it in a lightweight HTML/CSS desktop environment without Docker. This renders OS-themed window chrome, taskbars, and desktop styling around your GUI.

## Available Themes

| Theme   | Style                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `win11` | Windows 11 with rounded corners and centered taskbar |
| `macos` | macOS with top menu bar and dock                     |

## Usage

Set `provider: "simulated"` and choose a theme:

```python
import cua_bench as cb

@cb.tasks_config(split="train")
def load():
    return [
        cb.Task(
            description='Click the Submit button',
            computer={
                "provider": "simulated",  # Enables simulated desktop
                "setup_config": {
                    "os_type": "win11",  # win11 or macos
                    "width": 1920,
                    "height": 1080,
                }
            }
        )
    ]
```

Then preview:

```bash
cb interact tasks/my_task --variant-id 0
```

## Multiple Theme Variants

Generate tasks across different desktop themes:

```python
@cb.tasks_config(split="train")
def load():
    themes = ["win11", "macos"]

    return [
        cb.Task(
            description=f'Complete the form',
            computer={
                "provider": "simulated",
                "setup_config": {
                    "os_type": theme,
                    "width": 1280,
                    "height": 800,
                }
            }
        )
        for theme in themes
    ]
```

## Limitations

Simulated desktop runs in a browser, so it has some restrictions:

- **No shell actions**: Can't execute bash commands or scripts
- **No native apps**: Can't install or run real applications
- **HTML/CSS only**: Only works with custom GUIs created via `launch_window()` or `install_app()`

For tasks requiring shell access or native applications, use Docker or QEMU environments instead.

## Why Use Simulated Desktop?

- **No Docker**: Runs directly in browser with Playwright
- **Fast**: Instant startup, no VM boot time
- **Visual Diversity**: Train agents on different OS appearances
- **Deterministic**: Same theme always renders identically
- **Lightweight**: Run thousands in parallel

Use simulated desktop for quick iteration and agent development. Switch to Docker/QEMU when you need real OS environments.
