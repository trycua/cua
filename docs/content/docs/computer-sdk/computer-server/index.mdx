description: HTTP/WebSocket server for remote computer control
---

The Computer Server is an HTTP and WebSocket server that runs inside each Cua sandbox (VM or container). It exposes APIs for remote computer control - allowing the Computer SDK and agents to execute actions like clicking, typing, taking screenshots, and running commands on the sandboxed environment.

When you use `Computer(provider_type="cloud")` or any other provider, the Computer SDK communicates with this server running inside the sandbox to execute your automation commands.

## Key Features

- **REST API** - Execute commands, take screenshots, manage files
- **WebSocket API** - Real-time streaming for continuous interaction
- **Cross-platform** - Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows sandboxes
- **Secure** - Isolated inside the sandbox environment
